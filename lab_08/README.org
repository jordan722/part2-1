Jordan's Notes for Quymbee's Lab
What works:
  - The code for Task A is working but Quymbee used .erase() and
    I am not sure if we were supposed to use that.

What does not work:
  - Quymbee's countChar function does not do what it is supposed to do.
    Instead, it attempts to perform the task required for Task B. Renaming suggested.
  - Task B does not work properly
  - funcs.cpp does not compile
  - funcs.cpp and main.cpp contained the same exact code
